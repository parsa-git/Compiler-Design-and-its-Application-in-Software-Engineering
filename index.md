# Compiler design and its application is software engineering
By: **Dr. Saeed Parsa**

## Preface

Our laboraotry research interests lie in the areas of software engineering and compilers. I relate these two subjects through reverse engineering techniques. For the time being the main focus of my research is in software testing and reverse engineering. I use a mixture of compilers and statistical techniques and highly practical software engineering methods. I am interested in automated test data generation and fault localization. I have developed new methods and algorithms for detecting the domain of a program inputs rather than the inputs data, themselves. 

I believe that statistical approaches to fault localization are biased by the test sets and the bias could be avoided by applying the domain coverage criterion as a basis for evaluating the data sets. We have designed and developed some components to facilitate test data generation and automated fault localization. My main research areas are as following.

    Software Engineering: Including software methodologies, software refactoring,  dashboard system design, key performance indicators, and graph analysis.
    Software Testing: Including test data generation, domain testing, fuzz testing, and performance testing.
    Software Debugging: Including automatic fault localization, defect prediction, and automatic software repair.
